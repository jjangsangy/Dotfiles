Overview

The Global Replace plugin allows you to search and replace a pattern
across multiple files. The lines containing a specified pattern in multiple
files are displayed in a buffer. You can edit the lines in this buffer and 
make the desired modifications to them. The plugin can then 
incorporate these changes back into the corresponding files interactively.

The following commands are provided by this plugin:

:Gsearch         Search for a given pattern in the specified group of
                 files and display the matches in the replace buffer.
:Gbuffersearch   Search for a given pattern in all the buffers
                 in the Vim buffer list.
:Gargsearch      Search for a given pattern in all the files in the
                 Vim argument list.
:Gqfopen         Use the results from the quickfix list.
:Greplace        Incorporate the modifications from the replace buffer
                 into the corresponding files.

Refer to the greplace.txt help file for more information (available with the
plugin).

This plugin will run only on Vim version 7.0 and above.
